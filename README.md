# StarckLamp
The code for the lamp based on the designs of Philippe Starck.
The code will be in three parts; server, app, and pico.
The server powers the web server, the app is a flutter app designed to run on the user's phone and the pico is a raspberry pi pico w that will control the lamp directly.
